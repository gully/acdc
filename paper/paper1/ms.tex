\section{Observations and Data Reduction}
\subsection{TESS}
We programmatically acquired lightcurves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite \citep[TESS;][]{2014SPIE.9143E..20R} via the \texttt{lightkurve} Python library \citep{2018ascl.soft12013L}.  All \censorbox{7?} sources had at least one sector of TESS data available in the Full Frame Image (FFI) data.  Targets UCAC2~7201471 and \censorbox{other targets...} also had 2 minute cadence data available.  For these 2-minute cadence data we retrieve the Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC) lightcurves which have already undergone data quality assurance checks \citep{2020RNAAS...4..201C}.  For the FFI data, such quality assurance checks are not automatically applied, so we visually inspect the raw lightcurves, and apply standard masking for quality flags and obvious instrumental artifacts.  These lightcurves show such conspicuous signal strengths, that advanced lightcurve processing was not needed, and the raw flux time series can be used with minimal postprocessing.  Figure \ref{TESS_UCAC2} shows the TESS lightcurve for the target UCAC2~7201471.

  \caption{\label{TESS_UCAC2} TESS Sector 34 and 35 lightcurves for UCAC2~7201471.  The two sectors of data are separately normalized by their median values.  The six vertical blue lines indicate the moments of acquisition of IGRINS spectra from coordinated Gemini South observations.  The final IGRINS observation occurred just after TESS Sector 35 concluded. The dotted horizontal red line at flux of 0.905 highlights the lower envelope of flux minima for this source, indicating a peak-to-valley flux loss of 9.5\%.  This large lightcurve modulation suggests a significant longitudinal asymmetry of starspot coverage fraction with at least a 10\% coverage fraction of spots on the most spotted hemisphere.}

\subsection{IGRINS}
IGRINS acquired \censorbox{35?} individual spectra of 7 objects in Gemini South semester 2021A under program ID \texttt{GS-2021A-Q-311}.
