### Installation:

We might wish to experiment with new Early Release TESS data products as summarized in this [TESS GI Blog Post](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/a-beta-trial-of-quick-look-tess-orbit-data-early-release-of-sector-35-orbit-1-calibrated-full-frame-images.html).  Efficiently analyzing these data will require some experimental code called `TESS_cloud` developed by Geert Barentsen:
