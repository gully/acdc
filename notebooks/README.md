### 1. Observation planning and project heritage

In notebook `01.04` we planed the IGRINS observations.  We also explored the prospect of observing with other facilities.  

### 2. lightcurve analysis

We fetch the TESS Sector 34 - 39 (Cycle 3) data and plot the lightcurves overlaid with the dates of the IGRINS spectra.  We strive to compile ASAS-SN photometry when available.

### 3. IGRINS quick look

Here we analyze spot-check the IGRINS spectra from Gemini South, prep them for analysis, and set coarse prior limits.

### 4. IGRINS spectral decomposition

We conduct MCMC-based spectral inference on all spectra.


### 9. [deprecated]

Failed experiments or notebooks that have outlived their useful period can be moved here.
